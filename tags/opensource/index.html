<h2 id="Update"><a href="#Update" class="headerlink" title="Update"></a>Update</h2><ul>
<li><em>(2018.11) Oozie has Kerberos auth over SPNEGO for web (thanks to Justin Miller for pointing it out)</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Disclaimer"><a href="#Disclaimer" class="headerlink" title="Disclaimer"></a>Disclaimer</h2><p>I’m not an expert in any of those engines.<br>I’ve used some of those (Airflow &amp; Azkaban) and checked the code.<br>For some others I either only read the code (Conductor) or the docs (Oozie/AWS Step Functions).<br>As most of them are OSS projects, it’s certainly possible that I might have missed certain undocumented features,<br>or community-contributed plugins. I’m happy to update this if you see anything wrong.</p>
<p>Bottom line: Use your own judgement when reading this post.</p>
<h2 id="Airflow"><a href="#Airflow" class="headerlink" title="Airflow"></a>Airflow</h2><h3 id="The-Good"><a href="#The-Good" class="headerlink" title="The Good"></a>The Good</h3><p>Airflow is a super feature rich engine compared to all other solutions.<br>Not only you can use plugins to support all kinds of jobs,<br>ranging from data processing jobs: Hive, Pig (though you can also submit them via shell command),<br>to general flow management like triggering by existence of file/db entry/s3 content,<br>or waiting for expected output from a web endpoint,<br>but also it provides a nice UI that allows you to check your DAGs (workflow dependencies) through code/graph,<br>and monitors the real time execution of jobs.</p>
<p>Airflow is also highly customizable with a currently vigorous community.<br>You can run all your jobs through a single node using local executor,<br>or distribute them onto a group of worker nodes through Celery/Dask/Mesos orchestration.</p>
<h3 id="The-Bad"><a href="#The-Bad" class="headerlink" title="The Bad"></a>The Bad</h3><p>Airflow by itself is still not very mature (in fact maybe Oozie is the only “mature” engine here).<br>The scheduler would need to periodically poll the scheduling plan and send jobs to executors.<br>This means it along would continuously dump enormous amount of logs out of the box.<br>As it works by “ticking”, your jobs are not guaranteed to get scheduled in “real-time” if that makes sense<br>and this would get worse as the number of concurrent jobs increases.<br>Meanwhile as you have one centralized scheduler, if it goes down or gets stuck, your running jobs won’t be<br>affected as that the job of executors, but no new jobs will get scheduled. This is especially confusing when<br>you run this with a HA setup where you have multiple web nodes, a scheduler, a broker<br>(typically a message queue in Celery case), multiple executors. When scheduler is stuck for whatever reason,<br>all you see in web UI is all tasks are running, but in fact they are not actually moving forward while executors<br>are happily reporting they are fine. In other words, the default monitoring is still far from bullet proof.</p>
<p>The web UI is very nice from the first look. However it sometimes is confusing to new users.<br>What does it mean my DAG runs are “running” but my tasks have no state? The charts are not search friendly either,<br>let alone some of the features are still far from well documented<br>(though the document does look nice, I mean, compared to Oozie, which does seem out-dated).</p>
<p>The backfilling design is good in certain cases but very error prone in others.<br>If you have a flow with cron schedules disabled and re-enabled later, it would try to play catch up,<br>and if your jobs is not designed to be idempotent, shit would happen for real.</p>
<h2 id="Azkaban"><a href="#Azkaban" class="headerlink" title="Azkaban"></a>Azkaban</h2><h3 id="The-Good-1"><a href="#The-Good-1" class="headerlink" title="The Good"></a>The Good</h3><p>Of all the engines, Azkaban is probably the easiest to get going out of the box.<br>UI is very intuitive and easy to use. Scheduling and REST APIs works just fine.</p>
<p>Limited HA setup works out of the box.<br>There’s no need for load balancer because you can only have one web node.<br>You can configure how it selects executor nodes to push jobs to and it generally seems to scale pretty nicely.<br>You can easily run tens of thousands of jobs as long as you have enough capacity for the executor nodes.</p>
<h3 id="The-Bad-1"><a href="#The-Bad-1" class="headerlink" title="The Bad"></a>The Bad</h3><p>It is not very feature rich out of the box as a general purpose orchestration engine,<br>but likely that’s not what’s originally designed for. It’s strength lies in native support for Hadoop/Pig/Hive,<br>though you can also achieve those using command line. But itself cannot trigger jobs through external resources like<br>Airflow, nor does it support job waiting pattern. Although you can do busy waiting through java code/scripts, that<br>leads to bad resource utilization.</p>
<p>The documentation and configuration are generally a bit confusing compared to others. It’s likely that it wasn’t supposed<br>to be OSed at the beginning. The design is okish but you better have a big data center to run the executors as scheduling<br>would get stalled when executors run out of resources without extra monitoring stuff. The code quality overall is a bit towards<br>the lower end compared to others so it generally only scales well when resource is not a problem.</p>
<p>The setup/design is not cloud friendly. You are pretty much supposed to have stable bare metal rather than dynamically<br>allocated virtual instances with dynamic IPs. Scheduling would go south if machines vanish.</p>
<p>The monitoring part is sort of acceptable through JMX (does not seem documented). But it generally doesn’t work well if your<br>machines are heavily loaded, unfortunately, as the endpoints may get stuck.</p>
<h2 id="Conductor"><a href="#Conductor" class="headerlink" title="Conductor"></a>Conductor</h2><h3 id="The-Good-2"><a href="#The-Good-2" class="headerlink" title="The Good"></a>The Good</h3><p>It’s a bit unfair to put Conductor into this competition as it’s real purpose is for microservice orchestration, whatever that means.<br>It’s HA model involves a quorum of servers sitting behind load balancer putting tasks onto a message queue which the worker nodes would<br>poll from, which means it’s less likely you’ll run into stalled scheduling.<br>With the help of parameterized execution through API, it’s actually quite good at scheduling and scaling provided<br>that you set up your load balancer/service discovery layer properly.</p>
<h3 id="The-Bad-2"><a href="#The-Bad-2" class="headerlink" title="The Bad"></a>The Bad</h3><p>The UI needs a bit more love. There’s currently very limited monitoring there. Although for general purpose scheduling that’s probably<br>good enough.</p>
<p>It’s pretty bare-bone out of the box. There’s not even native support for running shell scripts, though it’s pretty easy to implement<br>a task worker through python to do the job with the examples provided.</p>
<h2 id="Oozie"><a href="#Oozie" class="headerlink" title="Oozie"></a>Oozie</h2><h3 id="The-Good-3"><a href="#The-Good-3" class="headerlink" title="The Good"></a>The Good</h3><p>Oozie provides a seemingly reliable HA model through the db setup (seemingly b/c I’ve not dug into it).<br>It provides native support for Hadoop related jobs as it was sort of built for that eco system.</p>
<h3 id="The-Bad-3"><a href="#The-Bad-3" class="headerlink" title="The Bad"></a>The Bad</h3><p>Not a very good candidate for general purpose flow scheduling as the XML definition is quite verbose<br>and cumbersome for defining light weight jobs.</p>
<p>It also requires quite a bit of peripheral setup. You need a zookeeper cluster, a db, a load balancer<br>and each node needs to run a web app container like Tomcat. The initial setup also takes some time which is<br>not friendly to first time users to pilot stuff.</p>
<h2 id="Step-Functions"><a href="#Step-Functions" class="headerlink" title="Step Functions"></a>Step Functions</h2><h3 id="The-Good-4"><a href="#The-Good-4" class="headerlink" title="The Good"></a>The Good</h3><p>Step Functions is fairly new (launch in Dec 2016). However the future seems promising. With the HA nature of cloud<br>platform and lambda functions, it almost feels like it can easily scale infinitely (compared to others).</p>
<p>It also offers some useful features for general purpose workflow handling like waiting support and dynamic branching<br>based on output.</p>
<p>It’s also fairly cheap:</p>
<ul>
<li>4,000 state transitions are free each month</li>
<li>$0.025 per 1,000 state transitions thereafter ($0.000025 per state transition)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don’t run tens of thousands of jobs, this might be even better than running your own cluster of things.</p>
<h3 id="The-Bad-4"><a href="#The-Bad-4" class="headerlink" title="The Bad"></a>The Bad</h3><p>Can only be used by AWS users. Deal breaker if you are not one of them yet.</p>
<p>Lambda requires extra work for production level iteration/deployment.</p>
<p>There’s no UI (well there is but it’s really just a console).<br>So if you need any level of monitoring beyond that you need to build it using cloudwatch by yourself.</p>
